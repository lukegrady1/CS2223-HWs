Brazen bells!
What tale of terror, now, their turbulency tells!ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ
In the startled ear of nightÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ
How they scream out their affright!ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ
Too much horrified to speak,ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ
They can only shriek, shriek,ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ
Out of tune,
In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire,
In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire,ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ
Leaping higher, higher, higher,ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ
With a desperate desire,ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ
And a resolute endeavorÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ
NowÑnow to sit or never,ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ
By the side of the pale-faced moon.ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ

What a tale their terror tellsÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ
Of Despair!ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ
How they clang, and clash, and roar!ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ
What a horror they outpour
On the bosom of the palpitating air!ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ
Yet the ear it fully knows,ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ
By the twanging,ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ
And the clanging,ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ
How the danger ebbs and flows;ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ
Yet the ear distinctly tells,ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ
In the jangling,ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ
And the wrangling.ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ
How the danger sinks and swells,
By the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bellsÑÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ
Of the bellsÑÊÊÊÊÊ
Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ

Iron bells!
What a world of solemn thought their monody compels!ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ
In the silence of the night,ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ
How we shiver with affrightÊÊ
At the melancholy menace of their tone!ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ
For every sound that floatsÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ
From the rust within their throatsÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ
Is a groan.ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ
And the peopleÑah, the peopleÑÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ

RollsÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ
A paean from the bells!ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ
And his merry bosom swellsÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ
With the paean of the bells!ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ
And he dances, and he yells;ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ
Keeping time, time, time,ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ
